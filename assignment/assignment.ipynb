        "1. This paper focuses on how to make data cleaning effective through data tidying. Data tidying is done with tidy datasets, which are datasets with each variable being a column, each observation a row, and each type of observational unit a table. The structure of tidy datasets allows them to easily fix messy datasets, manipulate and visualize the data, and develop tools for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is meant to help structure datasets to facilitate analysis. organise data values within a dataset. The standard makes data cleaning more effective because there is a structure to cleaning that doesn't have to be redone every time. It facilitates exploring and analyzing and developing tools for data cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy datasets are all standardized in the same way, so it's easy to understand even without knowing the depth of the data. Messy data can be messy in many different ways and will all be different. The second sentence is in reference to the fact that variables and observations can change depending on who is using the values and what meaning people are looking to derive.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Values belong to a variable and observation. A variable has all of the values that are measuring the same attribute, while an observation contains all of the values that are measured with the same unit. Values are collected into a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is a standard for mapping a dataset using the following structure:  each variable makes a column, each observation makes a row, each type of observation unit makes a new table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The five most common messy data mistakes are:\n",
        "- The column headers are values instead of variable names\n",
        "- multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "- the variables are stored in rows and columns\n",
        "- multiple observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "-a single observational unit is in multiple tables\n",
        "\n",
        "Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values instead of names and because variables are in the rows and columns. Melting a dataset means to stack it, or put columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because there are variables in the rows and columns. Table 12 has one variable for each column and each row is a one day observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The chicken and egg problem is that if tidy data can only be used with the tools created for it, then the tools will only ever be used for tidy data. Therefore, changing data structure and tools won't ever improve the workflow. Wickham hopes in the future that methodologies from other fields can improve understanding of cognitive data analysis and improve the design of appropriate data tools.\n"
